            <p>
              Task: Please use this HTML starter to produce a combined application, resume and
              portfolio. We use this format to provide you with a way to showcase your skills,
              creativity and personality in a more relatable and familiar format. Don't take things
              too seriously. We're more interested in the honesty of your responses than seeing you
              paint a perfect picture of yourself.
            </p>

            <p>
              We've added guides as to what information we want to see for each section, but
              otherwise, you're free to do what you want. The only constraint we have is you need
              to keep your submission to one HTML file. There are no other rules and we're open
              to everything else! Extra points for technical React usage (maybe a service
              architecture via the context API?) for producing a concise and visually stunning
              styling system or for anything else which is really impressive!
            </p>

            <p>
              How long should you spend on this? Just think of it as a normal job application and do
              what you feel is adequate. The level of work you put in is not a factor, weâ€™ll mainly
              be looking at how you approach it.
            </p>
