# Senior Front-end Engineers

Imagine being one of the earliest team members at Waze, building a product that would eventually be used by millions of people worldwide. What if you had the chance to design and build something that changes an entire industry? 

That's what we're doing here at Deckee. We're building the 'Waze for Boats' â€“ one of a kind software that is changing the way boaters plan, explore, socialise, and stay informed and safe on the water.

We're off to a great start and we are beginning to build out our development team with talented people that can help us pull off this big vision.

# About You

You are already set up as a consultant, contractor or freelancer (read: _a professional operator_) or you are looking to set yourself up in a professional capacity.

You are a strong critical thinker. You can always argue either side of a technical decision because you always approach it from both sides. 

You are highly driven. Development isn't so much a job or a career, you see it as a way of life. You have side-projects and ideas that you never get enough time to work on.

You have a continuing interest in learning and developing your skills outside the scope of what your paid work offers.

You are highly conscientious about your work, but business value is always the key driver in your approach.

You know that the quality of a job is not the work you perform, but the people you perform it with. 

You have strong opinions about your craft and the industry, but you enjoy hearing the point of view of others and you can be easily swayed.

# About Deckee

**We help boaters make better decisions, so they can have better and safer experiences on the water.**

We are an early stage start up. There are risks that come with that, but huge potential upside.

We are a remote-first team, based primarily between Newcastle Australia and San Francisco California.

We work closely with government organisations and maritime authorities in Australia.

We are an affirmative action employer. 

Our front-ends are SPA's written primarily in React. Our backend currently stands at ~25 backend services running within Kubernetes on GKE and consist primarily of node containers.

# You with Deckee

Our user base is currently undergoing hockey stick growth. We want you to help us continue drive this growth with new features and enable future features to be delivered faster and cheaper by keeping our technical debt low.

You will report directly with our CEO and CTO, planning and producing new features and updates for our existing app, while also taking ownership of a new, strategic greenfield project.

We work primarily in an asynchronous remote fashion. Work where you want, when you want, how you want. You're a professional, we trust that you already know how to perform at your best!

There are no limitations as to what you can take on. While the role is initially billed as a senior front-end engineer, we're envisioning it expanding as the company grows. We're more than happy for you to start taking the path you're most interested whether it is working across the entire code-base and getting deep into the backend, being the one to manage, lead and build out our future teams, or to get experience in any other function of the business.

# What we're looking for

## Required

We're less interested in your skills than we are your drive and critical thinking. Beyond everything else, it is your professional approach to your work which we want. Skill wise however, we're looking for the following:

- You write clean and easy to understand modular code. You are an advocate for abstractions and are skilled at producing simple declarative interfaces that expose the functionality of your well written imperative code.
- You don't just know the ins and out of React, you understand the core principles and motivations for using such a library.
- You have top skills with CSS and have knowledge how styled components and CSS modules work.
- You work well as an internal consultant when implementing designs. You are skilled at breaking designs into specific factors, obtaining prioritization of each factor based on complexity and costs, and can offer alternatives when they exist.
- You are up to date with the current ES features and know when and how you should use them.
- You have basic knowledge and experience with Docker and the Linux command line. Everything we do is containerised.
- You have all the assumed table stakes, you can rebase a branch in git, use ssh, perform simple scripting, linting, writing tests etc.

## Bonuses

Any experience with any of the following technologies we use or are in our roadmap are definitely a bonus. Don't be concerned if you haven't got any experience with anything listed, it is more for a taste of what you might get the opportunity to work with.

- Front-end libraries of D3, Mapbox and any geospatial experience.
- Back-end libraries including Express, Async, Moleculer.
- Kubernetes or similar orchestration systems.
- Databases such as ElasticSearch, MySQL and Mongo. Knowledge of graph databases such as Neo4j also beneficial.
- Cordova, GraphQL, OpenFaaS / serverless, Nginx, LetsEncrypt, Cloudflare, Strapi, AMQP, Postman, Webpack, OpenVPN, Systemctl, Rancher, Metabase.
- Lots of testing experience, high level of code-review skills, CI experience and system administration, GPG and other forms of cryptography, building ETL systems or any data science experience.
- GCP expertise is great, AWS or Azure experience is good also.
- Any strong PHP or bash skills and experience.

**Any design skills using Sketch are also highly regarded!**

# Whats on offer

Remuneration includes the lifestyle benefits of working in a location agnostic, asynchronous, remote role.

Equity incentives are available and negotiable based on experience.

A pro-rata rate between $78,000 and $90,000 is available based on your expertise.

**We are also open to part-time workers, weekenders and equity-only positions. Want to get involved but not in a full-time capacity, pitch us your thoughts!**
